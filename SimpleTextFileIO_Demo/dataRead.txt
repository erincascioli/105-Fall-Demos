This text from the file will be read in
one line at a time. The while loop ensures
that the text will keep being read until the
end-of-text character is encountered, at which the
ReadLine() method will return null. That will not occur
until there is no more text in a file.

You can have line breaks in a file but they don't count
as end of file.

Now it's the end. There's nothing more after this period.
